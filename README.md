# C++ Customized ostreams

This repository contains implementations of two custom ostreams:

### IndentStream

IndentStream is an ostream that is capable of handling a variable amount of indentations. One can increase the amount of 
line-beginning indentations by applying the `indent` ostream manipulator to an IndentStream. Similarly, one can decrease the 
amount of indentations by applying the `unindent` manipulator.

This was implemented as part of an assignment for MPCS51045: Advanced C++.

### ColorStream

ColorStream is an ostream with manipulators that can change the color of text. There are two ways in which the user can
edit the color of text:

- One can color a specific piece of text by using the `Color` class's static `color` method.
- One can color the text until either the color is changed or until the default color is restored. One can start coloring a block
of text by using the `begin` manipulator with the color being chosen by specifying the name of the color as the manipulator's
sole template argument.

As color changes are chosen using a function template with a class argument, a color must be encapsulated in a type. These
types are auto-generated by `ColorStream/utils/ColorGenerator.cpp`; a user only needs to specify the name of the color
followed by a semicolon-separated list of the color's RGB representation in `ColorStream/utils/ColorList.txt`. The class generation
uses an `IndentStream` to write directly into `ColorTypes.hpp` in a formatted manner.
